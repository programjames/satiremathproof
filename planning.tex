	My project is a math paper proving that higher power roots of $2$ are irrational. I satirize the unique culture of proof writing. Just as scientists are often told to ``say it again, but in English," mathematicians have a different way of writing that is unnecessarily confusing to those outside the math community.
	\par
	I already had most of the ideas for what I would satirize when I began the project; The hardest part was finding a roundabout method to prove the theorem while employing all of my satire (the most intuitive proof would only have taken one or two short paragraphs, not over a page). After writing my rough draft I had a few people take a look at my paper and added some more stuff based on their suggestions.
	\par Below this page is my paper, and below that I have color coded my proof and given explanations for what each part is satirizing.
